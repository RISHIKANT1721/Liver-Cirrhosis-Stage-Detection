Liver Cirrhosis Stage Detection
This repository contains the code and resources for a Liver Cirrhosis Stage Detection system built using machine learning techniques. The goal of this project is to accurately classify the stages of liver cirrhosis using patient data and a Random Forest (RF) algorithm.


Liver cirrhosis is a chronic liver disease characterized by liver fibrosis and progressive deterioration of liver function. Detecting the stage of cirrhosis accurately can aid in timely intervention and management. This project employs a Random Forest algorithm to classify liver cirrhosis into its various stages based on patient data.

Model
The Random Forest algorithm was chosen for this classification task due to its robustness and ability to handle complex datasets with multiple features. The model was trained and fine-tuned using the following approach:

Feature Selection: Relevant features were selected based on their correlation with the target variable.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Grid search and cross-validation were used to optimize hyperparameters like the number of trees, maximum depth, etc.
Evaluation Metrics: Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
